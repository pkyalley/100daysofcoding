# Instructions
    # Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

    # It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

    # Under 18.5 they are underweight
    # Equal to or over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
    # Equal to or over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
    # Equal to or over 30 but below 35 they are obese
    # Equal to or over 35 they are clinically obese.

# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
    # The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height,
    # and is expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms (kg) and height in metres (m).

# Important: 
    # You do not need to round the result to the nearest whole number. 
    # It's fine to print out a floating point number for this exercise. 
    # The interpretation message needs to include the words from the interpretations above. 
    # e.g. underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, clinically obese.

# Example Input 1
# 1.50
# 63
# Example Output 1
# Your BMI is 28.0, you are slightly overweight.
# since 63 ÷ (1.50 x 1.50) = 28

# The testing code will check for print output that is formatted like one of the lines below:
    # "Your BMI is 18.28678, you are underweight."
    # "Your BMI is 22.0, you have a normal weight."
    # "Your BMI is 28.50752, you are slightly overweight."
    # "Your BMI is 32.56189, you are obese."
    # "Your BMI is 37.50000, you are clinically obese."

# Example Input 2
# 1.60
# 96
# Example Output 2
# Your BMI is 37.49999999999999, you are clinically obese.

# Example Input 3
# 1.71
# 73
# Example Output 3
# Your BMI is 24.96494647925858, you have a normal weight.

# Enter your height in meters e.g., 1.55
height = float(input())
# Enter your weight in kilograms e.g., 72
weight = int(input())
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇

# Solution:

floatHeight = float(height)
floatWeight = float(weight) 

bmi = floatWeight/floatHeight**2

if bmi < 18.5:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are underweight.")
elif bmi >= 18.5 and bmi < 25:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you have a normal weight.")
elif bmi >= 25 and bmi < 30:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are slightly overweight.")
elif bmi >= 30 and bmi < 35:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are obese.")
elif bmi >= 35:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are clinically obese.")
