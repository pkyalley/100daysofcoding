# 100daysofcoding

A dedicated repository to track my journey of learning Python through the #100DaysOfCoding challenge. This repository will serve as a log of my daily progress, including code snippets, projects, and notes on concepts learned.

## Purpose
This repository is designed to:

- Document daily progress.
- Track consistency in learning Python.
- Showcase growth in coding skills.
- Encourage accountability and discipline.

## Structure
The repository will be organized as follows:

- `day-1/`: Includes lessons, codes, and notes for Day 1.
- `day-2/`: Includes lessons, codes, and notes for Day 2.
- ...
- `README.md`: Contains an overview of the project and updates on milestones.

## Goals
1. Complete at least one coding exercise or project daily.
2. Focus on improving problem-solving and programming logic.
3. Document all learning experiences and challenges faced.

## How to Use
Feel free to explore the daily folders to see my progress and learn alongside me. Each folder contains:

- Code: The Python scripts for the day.
- Notes: Key takeaways and concepts learned.
