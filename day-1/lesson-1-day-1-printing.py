# Instructions
    # Write a program that uses print statements to print the following recipe into the Output console.
    # The text to print is already there, you just need to make it into code.
    # Your code should print all five lines exactlythe same as the example output below.

# Example Output
    # 1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.
    # 2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.
    # 3. Add 3g of Salt.
    # 4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.
    # 5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.


# Solution

ingridients1 = "1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl."
ingridients2 = "2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes."
ingridients3 = "3. Add 3g of Salt."
ingridients4 = "4. Leave to rise for 2 hours."
ingridients5 = "5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes."

print(ingridients1)
print(ingridients2)
print(ingridients3)
print(ingridients4)
print(ingridients5)

# Comment
    # I assigned each ingredient to a variable for reusability instead of printing directly.
    # I did not use a loop to iterate ingredients as it was not required.
