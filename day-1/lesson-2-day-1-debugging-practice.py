# Instructions
    # Look at the code in the code editor on the left.
    # There are errors on all 4 lines of code.
    # Fix the code so that it runs without errors.

# Example Output
    # Day 1 - String Manipulation
    # String Concatenation is done with the  sign.
    # e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
    # New lines can be created with a backslash and n.

# # Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡
    # print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
    # print(String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
    #   print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
    # print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
      
# Solution

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

# Comments
# I corrected the syntax errors by:
    # Adding a missing opening quote in the first print statement.
    # Ensuring all strings are properly enclosed in quotes.
    # Removing an extra parenthesis in the last print statement.
    # Ensuring consistent indentation.
